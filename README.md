This intermediate level data set has 750 rows and 16 columns.
This dataset contains weekly data for the Dow Jones Industrial Index. It has been used in computational investing research.
In this dataset, each record (row) is data for a week. Each record also has the percentage of return that stock has in the following week (percent_change_next_weeks_price). 
Ideally, this could be used to determine which stock will produce the greatest rate of return in the following week. 

This data set is recommended for learning and practicing your skills in exploratory data analysis, data visualization, clustering and regression/classification modelling techniques.
